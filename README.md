Applying the Pandas Package

## Project Choice
I chose to perform the District Assessment, because my wife is an educator.
I also tackled the Heroes of Pymoli project, because I wanted to see if my performance increased on the second project.  Sadly, it was just the second verse of the same slow song.

## Observable Trends
I chose to report the observable trends in the Jupiter Notebooks,
because of the proximity of the supporting tables.
